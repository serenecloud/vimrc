# vimrc

This is my personal vimrc that I use at work for Ruby on Rails development. It's based on https://github.com/amix/vimrc with additions:

* Includes rails-vim https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails
* Theme tweaks to make it looks great on a black-background standatd terminal
* Disable the mouse pointer integration
* Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right and :t shortcuts for vim tabs
