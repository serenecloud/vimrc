# vimrc

This is my personal vimrc that I use at work for Ruby on Rails development. It's based on https://github.com/amix/vimrc with additions:

* Includes vim-rails https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails
* Theme tweaks to make it looks great on a black-background standard terminal
* Disable the mouse pointer integration
* Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right and :t shortcuts for vim tabs

# Installation

* Clone the repository
* Symlink the contained <code>.vimrc</code> file and <code>.vim_runtime</code> folder to your home directory
* Add <code>export TERM=xterm-256color</code> to your <code>.bashrc</code> if you don't already have it

# Appearance
